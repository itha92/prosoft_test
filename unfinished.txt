List of not finished requirements:
--	Weekends in yellow
--  Holidays in orange

Bugs:
--	When specified date is greater than 2 year, years start adding one for each month
--	if starting date is close to the end of the month and the quantity of month displayed have less days that the amount required it won't color all the necesary days.

Things I would do
--	Color the rest of the days according to how it supposed to be
--	Fix the bugs and do more testing
--	Modify layout to make it look pretier.
